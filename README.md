# Telecom Customer Retention Dashboard

This repository contains a customer retention analysis dashboard created as part of the PwC Switzerland online internship. The objective was to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer retention and build a Power BI dashboard to visualize customer demographics and insights, ultimately providing actionable recommendations to the engagement partner.

## Project Overview

Telecom customers are highly valuable and hard-earned, so minimizing churn is crucial for sustaining revenue and growth. This project analyzes customer data to help the retention department transition from a reactive to a proactive approach, identifying customers at risk of churn and visualizing critical retention insights.

### Key Features
- **KPI Definition**: The KPIs for this analysis include churn rate, monthly charges, contract types, and customer demographics such as age, partner status, and dependents.
- **Dashboard Visualizations**: Developed in Power BI, the dashboard visualizes:
  - **Customer Risk**: Highlights customers at high risk of churn, using metrics like contract type, tenure, and billing information.
  - **Demographics**: Visualizes gender, age, partner status, and more, providing a clear view of the customer base.
  - **Subscription & Payment Patterns**: Analyzes subscription durations, payment methods, and monthly charges to identify patterns associated with customer retention.
  - **Churn Insights by Service Types**: Displays churn likelihood across internet services, streaming, and tech support usage.

### Findings
- **High Churn Risk**: Customers on month-to-month contracts and those using fiber optic internet show higher churn rates.
- **Payment Preferences**: Customers paying via electronic check have a noticeably higher churn rate than other payment methods, suggesting a potential focus area for retention.
- **Demographic Impact**: Senior citizens and customers with dependents showed different churn risks, highlighting the need for tailored retention strategies.

### Recommendations
1. **Early Identification**: Proactively reach out to customers showing high churn probability based on their subscription type, tenure, and monthly charges.
2. **Payment Method Influence**: Consider incentivizing customers on high-churn payment methods (e.g., electronic check) to switch to lower-risk options.
3. **Customized Retention Offers**: Develop targeted retention offers for month-to-month contract holders and high-risk demographics.

## Dashboard
